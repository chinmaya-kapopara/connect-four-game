# Connect Four Game
Connect Four is a two-player connection board game, designed by Howard Wexler and Ned Strongin, which is also known as Plot Four, Four Up, Four in a Line, Four in  a Row, Drop Four and Gravitrips. We applied our knowledge of the Minimax algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm to develop the Connect Four game from scratch. While developing the game, we did some rigorous testing of how AI is behaving in different situations which in turn taught us what is the importance of heuristics and how differently AI reacted by a slight change of heuristics value. The main hero for AI based board games is heuristics.
